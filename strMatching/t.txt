Soldiers!
 Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! 
Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. 
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! 
You are not machines! 
You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. 
You don't hate, only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!

Soldiers! 
Don't fight for slavery! 
Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St Luke, it is written the kingdom of God is within man not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! 
In you! 
You, the people, have the power - the power to create machines. 
The power to create happiness! 
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful - to make this life a wonderful adventure. 
Then in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. 
Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.

By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. 
But they lie! 
They do not fulfil that promise. 
They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. 
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! 
Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. 
Let us fight for a world of reason - a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. 
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!
